# Uppsala University: Language Abstraction for Parallel Programming

This repository contains my hand in assingment code for the course "Language Abstraction for Parallel Programming".

The code most likely is not bug free but might still be intersting.
The second and third assignments use build scripts which allow you to run simply by using `./run.sh`.
Moreover they include some basic test.
